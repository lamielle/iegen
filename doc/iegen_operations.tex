\begin{section}{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{I}{EGen} is a tool for generating irregular computational kernels optimized using the Inspector/Executor strategy.
The user provides a description of the computational kernel and the desired runtime program transformations.
IEGen then produces code that implements the corresponding inspector and executor for this computation.

\begin{section}{Description of formula data structure}

IEGen is built upon and utilizes the mathematical concept of Presburger formulas.
However, we have introduced one unique addition to this well-known concept: the use of uninterpreted function symbols to represent indirect array accesses.
Few libraries have been written that work with Presburger formulas in this capacity--with full logic support for manipulating formulas that include uninterpreted functions.
The closest library is Omega (citation needed).
However, Omega's support for uninterpreted function symbols is lacking.
Some operations support and work with uninterpreted functions, some don't, and some produce incorrect results. (example for thesis)
Therefore, we were forced to develop our own implementation of Presburger formulas that includes correct 

The following are some of the features included in IEGen related to working with Presburger formulas:

\begin{itemize}
\item A data structure for representing arbitrary formulas
\item A parser for converting textual string descriptions of a formula to the equivalent in-memory data structure
\item String generation support for producing a human-readable version of an in-memory formula
\item Various operations for manipulating and combining formulas
\item A variety of simplification routines that convert one formula to an equivalent, but simplified, version
\end{itemize}

We support the following aspects of presburger formulas:

\begin{itemize}
\item Sets
\item Relations
\item AND
\item OR
\item One implicit level of existential quantifiers
\item Equality
\item Inequality
\item Uninterpreted function symbols
\item Symbolic Variables
\end{itemize}

The data structure for representing formulas consists of the following classes:

\begin{itemize}
\item Formula:
	The base class for both Set and Relation.
	This contains any common functionality between these two classes.
\item Set:
	A Set represents a set of integer tuples restricted by the given constraints.
	A Set consists of the disjunction of a collection of PresSets.
\item Relation:
	A Relation abstractly represents some mapping from input tuples to output tuples restricted by the given constraints.
	A Relation consists of the disjunction of a collection of PresRelations.
\item PresForm:
	The base class for both PresSet and PresRelation.
	This contains any common functionality between these two classes.
\item PresSet:
	Represents a Presburger set of the form `\{ [tuple variables] : constraints \}'.
\item PresRelation:
	Represents a Presburger relation of the form `\{ [input tuple variables] $\rightarrow$ [output tuple variables] : constraints \}'.
\item VarTuple:
	Contains the collection of variables that represent a PresSet's set tuple variables or a PresRelation's input or output tuple variables.
\item Conjunction:
	Contains a collection of Constraints that are, as it is a conjunction, ANDed together.
\item Constraint:
	Represents one of two types of constraints: Equality or Inequality.
	This contains any common functionality between these two classes.
\item Equality:
	Represents an equality constraint of the form: NormExp $=0$.
\item Inequality:
	Represents an inequality constraint of the form: NormExp $>=0$.
\item Expression:
	The base class for all expressions.
	This contains any common functionality between all expression types.
\item VarExp:
	Represents a variable expression of the form: $vc*v$ where $vc$ is an integer constant and $v$ is the variable name.
\item FuncExp
	Represents a function expression of the form: $fc*f(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n})$ where $fc$ is an integer constant, $f$ is the function name, and the $n$ $a_{i}$ terms are the arguments to the functions defined as NormExps.
\item NormExp:
	Represents an expression of the form: $vc_{1}*v_{1} + vc_{2}*v_{2} + \ldots + vc_{n}*v_{n} + fc_{1}*f_{1} + fc_{2}*f_{2} + \ldots + fc_{m}*f_{m} + c = 0$ where the $n$ $v_{i}$ are variables (VarExps), the $vc_{i}$ are integer constants, the $m$ $f_{i}$ are functions (FuncExps), the $fc_{i}$ are integer constants, and $c$ is an integer constant.
	This is essentially an affine expression with the addition that functions may also be included in the terms.

\begin{section}{Description of High Level Operations}

\emph{``I would like you to write up what operations you have implemented and the following information about each:
\begin{itemize}
\item How general the implementation is and what the limitations are
\item How extensively each operation has been tested
\item Other operations an operation may depend on''
\end{itemize}}

Arity querying: We are able to query a Set or Relation for its arity.
For Sets, it is simply the set tuple's arity.
For Relations, there is an arity method that returns a 2-tuple of (input\_arity,output\_arity).
There are also individual methods for both the input and output arity.
There is one comprehensive test for many tuple sizes for the Set and Relation arity methods.

Union: Implemented in both Set and Relation.
No limitations exist for this operation as it is quite simple.
There are four tests for each of the Set and Relation union implementations.

Apply: Implemented in Set.
We are able to apply a Relation to a Set.
This operation is limited in the naming/renaming aspects.
If we apply a Relation to a Set with conflicting names, issues may aries.
Apply has 8 test cases implemented.

Compose: Implemented in Relation.
We are able to compose two Relations.
This operation has the same limitations as apply in terms of renaming.
Compose has 8 test cases implemented.

Inverse: Implemented in Relation.
We are able to take the inverse of a Relation.
This operation has no limitations.
This operation has 2 test cases written.

Codegen: We can generate code from a Set.

Some sub operations that the main operations use:

arity methods depend on arity methods of PresSet/PresRelation (not tested directly, methods checked for)

inverse -> invert\_dict

apply/compose -> \_combine\_pres\_formulas,\_get\_rename\_dict,\_get\_unrename\_dict

\begin{section}{Description of Simplification Operations}

Simplification steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item Merge terms
\item Remove zero coefficients
\item Remove empty constraints
\item remove duplicate constraints (needed, but unimplemented)
\item remove symbolics
\item remove free variable equalities
\item remove free variable inequalities (partially implemented)
\item remove duplicate formulas
\end{itemize}
